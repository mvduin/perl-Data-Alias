  * update for context stack changes in Perl 5.23.8

  * update to accommodate PERL_OP_PARENT builds of Perl 5.21.11 or later
    (which is the default from Perl 5.25.1)

  * update for removal of LEX_KNOWNEXT in Perl 5.25.1

  * update test suite to not rely on . in @INC, which is no longer
    necessarily there from Perl 5.25.7

  * use cleaner wrap_op_checker() API to control op checking

version 1.20; 2015-10-21

  * bugfix: avoid some C undefined behaviour from unsequenced side effects
    that in practice bit when using a newer gcc (4.9 rather than 4.7)
    with the parser token stack change in Perl 5.21.9

  * add doc note advising users to prefer the core aliasing facility on
    Perl 5.22

version 1.19; 2015-10-21

  * bugfix: properly maintain op_last when munging ops

  * update for increased specialness of OP_PUSHMARK in Perl 5.21.6

  * update for distinct PADNAMELIST type in Perl 5.21.7

  * update for multideref optimisation in Perl 5.21.7, by a disgusting
    hack that depends on a flaw in the optimisation (which may disappear
    in the future) and which disables the optimisation entirely

  * add MYMETA.json to .gitignore

version 1.18; 2013-09-21

  * bugfix: store peep chain link reliably under threads

  * update tests for Perl 5.19.4's removal of the special treatment of
    aliased undef in arrays

  * in doc, switch to consistent use of British English spellings

  * doc typo fix

version 1.17; 2013-08-04

  * bugfix: correct the dtrace-related macro squashing for Perls prior
    to 5.13.8, where the macros had the wrong number of parameters and
    prevented compilation

  * bugfix: use core's PL_no_localize_ref string constant as data string
    rather than format string

  * update to handle the new padrange op type in Perl 5.17.6

  * update to handle the new op allocation mechanism in Perl 5.17.2

  * remove the bulk of the documentation from the README file

version 1.16; 2011-11-17

  * bugfix: use supported API to put destructor calls on the save stack
    (the unsupported way used before was wrong for 64-bit systems on
    perl 5.13.1 and later)

  * document the behaviour of "alias return" in more detail

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

version 1.15; 2011-06-21

    aelemfast and aelemfast_lex

  * test compatibility with Devel::CallParser

version 1.14; 2011-04-27

  * bugfix: never unhook peephole optimiser, because unhooking is liable
    to fail if anything else hooked it

  * bugfix: revise check for dorassign opcode to cope with FreeBSD's
    mutant Perl 5.8 that has it

  * test POD syntax and coverage

version 1.13; 2011-04-25

  * bugfix: prevent the lexer getting confused if the first thing inside
    an alias{} block is an open paren

  * bugfix: don't crash if an rv2cv op is built with PL_parser null

  * bugfix: handle variant structure of entersub op which lacks (ex-)list
    op as direct child

  * bugfix: squash bogus dtrace-related macro definitions that are picked
    up due to defining PERL_CORE

  * switch all pp functions to internal linkage

  * avoid some compiler warnings

  * include .cvsignore file in distribution

1.12  Tue Feb 22 20:47 GMT 2011
	- Updated to work with Perl version 5.13.10, where GvGP() and
	  GvCV() are not directly-assignable lvalues

1.11  Thu Jan 13 20:23 GMT 2011
	- Don't rely on details of core's pp_* functions to determine

1.09  Mon Nov 15 21:36 GMT 2010
	- Modify source filter test to use Filter::Util::Call directly
	  instead of the deprecated Switch, and to not fail if it is not

	  are managed in a different way from before

    - bugfix: correct the dtrace-related macro squashing for Perls prior
      to 5.13.8, where the macros had the wrong number of parameters and

1.16  2011-11-17  ZEFRAM

      aelemfast and aelemfast_lex
    - test compatibility with Devel::CallParser

1.14  2011-04-27  ZEFRAM
    - bugfix: never unhook peephole optimiser, because unhooking is liable
      to fail if anything else hooked it
    - bugfix: revise check for dorassign opcode to cope with FreeBSD's
      mutant Perl 5.8 that has it
    - test POD syntax and coverage

    - bugfix: prevent the lexer getting confused if the first thing inside
      an alias{} block is an open paren
    - bugfix: don't crash if an rv2cv op is built with PL_parser null
    - bugfix: handle variant structure of entersub op which lacks (ex-)list
      op as direct child
    - bugfix: squash bogus dtrace-related macro definitions that are picked
      up due to defining PERL_CORE
    - switch all pp functions to internal linkage

1.12  2011-02-22  ZEFRAM

      GvCV() are not directly-assignable lvalues

1.11  2011-01-13  ZEFRAM
    - Don't rely on details of core's pp_* functions to determine
      whether an opcode exists, because they can change unpredictably
      (and do change in Perl 5.13.9)

1.10  2010-11-21  ZEFRAM
    - Updated to work with Perl version 5.13.7, where lex_end()
      has disappeared and mod() is now in the public API under the
      name op_lvalue()

1.09  2010-11-15  ZEFRAM
    - Modify source filter test to use Filter::Util::Call directly
      instead of the deprecated Switch, and to not fail if it is not
      available, thus allowing tests to pass on Perl versions 5.13.1
      and above where Switch is no longer in the core distribution
    - Updated to work with Perl version 5.13.6, where global variables
      are managed in a different way from before

1.08  2010-10-22  ZEFRAM
    - Updated to work with Perl versions 5.11.0 up to 5.13.0,

NAME

Data::Alias - Comprehensive set of aliasing operations

DESCRIPTION

Aliasing is the phenomenon where two different expressions actually
refer to the same thing.  Modifying one will modify the other, and if
you take a reference to both, the two values are the same.

Data::Alias is a module that allows you to apply "aliasing semantics"
to a section of code, causing aliases to be made whereever Perl would
normally make copies instead.  You can use this to improve efficiency
and readability, when compared to using references.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
